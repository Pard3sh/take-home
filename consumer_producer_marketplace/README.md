# Pardesh's Suggestions

Integrating a compelling story for the single player option.

Currently the player's incentive when playing only will be to get the highest score possible for no other reason than getting a high number.

To add another level of motivation, we can add a family mechanic to this game. After each session, the player will have to set aside a portion of capital for rent, for feeding their family, and for other (explained soon) reasons. They will be able to select feeding their family or not (and which exact family members) (rent is not optional at all). If a family member is not fed, you save money for that day, but they have a chance of getting sick. When they are sick you will have to spend **more** money to treat them. Now the producer has a predicament: Be honest and possibly starve their family when they cannot pay for rent with their products or start lying to make more money. To add another layer of moral dilemna, I have opted to make all the products medicine.

While this is a bit dark, I beleive some sort of compelling narrative like this gives real incentive for the player to be invested and try to earn money. On top of the layer of strategy, there is a moral layer now. This mechanic can definitely be tweaked and modified a lot to better fit the purposes of the study.
